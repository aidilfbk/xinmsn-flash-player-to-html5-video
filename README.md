xinmsn video to &lt;video /&gt;
=============

A small javascript bookmarklet to replace [video.xin.msn.com](http://video.xin.msn.com)'s Flash Player with the HTML5 &lt;video /&gt; tag. Useful with devices that do not support Flash (i.e. iOS) or those who would rather defer video playback to the OS.
